To fetch a user's health report using the fetch_report.php script, you need to pass the email ID as a parameter in the URL. 
For instance, you can include the email ID in the URL like this: fetch_report.php?email=user@example.com. 
This URL will retrieve the health report for the user with the email ID "user@example.com".
